# ShopperAI
This project aims to build an AI-powered application that predicts the likelihood of a customer making a purchase. Using a real-world e-commerce dataset and the PyTorch Lightning framework, we will develop and train a machine learning model to analyze customer behavior and forecast purchase probabilities.

Key Features:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering: Transforming raw data into a suitable format for model training.
Model development with PyTorch Lightning: Leveraging the PyTorch Lightning framework for efficient and scalable model training.
Model evaluation and selection: Assessing the performance of different models to choose the best one.
Application development: Creating a user-friendly interface (e.g., web application, API) for interacting with the trained model.
Goals:

Gain practical experience in building and deploying a machine learning application.
Explore the capabilities of PyTorch Lightning for simplifying and accelerating AI development.
Develop a model that can accurately predict customer purchase likelihood.
Create a reusable and deployable application for real-world use cases.
This project is intended for educational and experimental purposes. It demonstrates the process of building an AI-powered application from data preprocessing to model deployment.
